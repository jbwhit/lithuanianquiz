# Lithuanian Language Learning App PRD

## Context & Problem Statement
Learning Lithuanian presents unique challenges due to its complex grammatical cases and number-related expressions. Students struggle to master various grammatical forms while learning to express numbers in different contexts (prices, ages, times, years). Existing solutions don't effectively adapt to individual learning patterns or systematically address these interconnected challenges.

## Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: Complete beginners to early intermediate learners
- **Motivation**: Travel and conversational proficiency
- **Age Group**: High school and older adults
- **Learning Style**: Practice-focused learners who benefit from repetition and contextual usage

## Proposed Solution
A Lithuanian learning application that uses adaptive learning techniques to help users master both numerical expressions and their associated grammatical forms through focused practice.

### Core Features

#### 1. Hierarchical Exercise System
- **Top-level categories**: Numbers
- **Exercise types**: Prices, Ages, Time, Years
- **Specific exercise patterns**: kiek_kainuoja, kokia_kaina
- **Grammatical cases**: Accusative, nominative, etc.
- **Number patterns**: Decades, single digits, special patterns

#### 2. Adaptive Learning Engine
Implements Thompson sampling to:
- Track user performance across all hierarchical levels
- Generate questions targeting weak areas
- Maintain learning history to optimize question selection

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Initial state**: 1 wrong answer assumed in every arm (exercise type)
- **Update mechanism**: Standard beta distribution update (alpha+1 for correct, beta+1 for incorrect)
- **Exploration vs. exploitation**: 20% random exercises, 80% targeted at weak areas
- **Adaptation threshold**: Algorithm begins meaningful adaptation after 10 answered questions

#### 3. Performance Tracking System
Monitors success rates by:
- Exercise type
- Grammatical case
- Number pattern
- Combined performance metrics
- Overall progress

### User Experience

#### User Journey
1. **First Visit**: User creates account → completes brief orientation → starts with basic price exercises
2. **Regular Session**: User logs in → system presents personalized exercise set → user receives immediate feedback → progress is tracked → next exercises are adapted based on performance
3. **Progression**: As proficiency increases in one area, system gradually introduces new number contexts

#### Interface
- Clean, distraction-free design
- Exercise selection available by category without exposing the hierarchical system
- Optional links to relevant grammatical rules
- Clear feedback via alerts and visual score tracking

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
1. **User Authentication**: Google Auth integration
2. **Exercise Types**: Price-related exercises only
3. **Adaptive System**: Basic Thompson sampling implementation
4. **Performance Tracking**: Core metrics for individual exercise types
5. **Feedback System**: Correct/incorrect answers with proper forms shown

## Future Enhancements
1. Additional grammatical cases and constructions
2. More complex number usage scenarios (ages, time, years)
3. Integration with vocabulary learning
4. Spaced repetition features
5. Difficulty progression system
6. Audio pronunciation components

## Authentication & Data
- **User Accounts**: Google Authentication
- **Data Storage**: User profiles with exercise history and performance metrics
- **Privacy**: Minimal personal data collection, focused on learning performance
- **Data Retention**: Performance data stored for algorithm optimization and progress tracking
- **Offline Functionality**: Not supported in MVP

## Success Metrics
- **Retention**: 40%+ users return for at least 5 sessions
- **Engagement**: Average session duration of 10+ minutes
- **Learning Effectiveness**:
  - 15% improvement in accuracy after 10 sessions
  - Reduced error rates in previously problematic areas
- **Algorithm Effectiveness**:
  - Demonstrable convergence on user weak areas
  - Balanced coverage across numerical patterns

## Testing Approach
1. **A/B Testing**: Compare adaptive vs. random exercise selection with test user groups
2. **Algorithm Validation**: Simulate user profiles with known weaknesses to verify targeting
3. **User Testing**: Gather qualitative feedback on exercise difficulty and adaptation
4. **Performance Analysis**: Track error rates over time to validate improvement curves

## Feedback Mechanism
- In-app reporting for exercise issues or content errors
- Feature request capability
- Optional user surveys after milestone completion

## Rollout Strategy
1. Initial release with price-related exercises
2. Addition of age-related exercises
3. Integration of time-telling exercises
4. Addition of year/date exercises
5. Continuous refinement of adaptive algorithm based on user data

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic exercise structure and tracking system
2. Develop and test Thompson sampling implementation
3. Create initial set of exercises for prices
4. Test adaptive learning effectiveness
5. Gather user feedback and iterate
