# Lithuanian App Implementation Todo

## 1. Core Database Structure
- [ ] Design database schema to support hierarchical exercise system
- [ ] Create tables for exercise types, patterns, grammatical cases, and number patterns
- [ ] Set up database migration scripts
- [ ] Add fields to track per-user performance at each hierarchical level

## 2. Adaptive Learning Engine
- [ ] Implement Thompson sampling algorithm
  - [ ] Create beta distribution initialization with 1 incorrect answer per arm
  - [ ] Develop sampling logic for exercise selection
  - [ ] Build update mechanism for success/failure tracking
- [ ] Create exploration/exploitation balance (80/20 split)
- [ ] Add exercise selection logic based on learning history
- [ ] Develop session-to-session memory of user performance

## 3. Exercise Content Expansion
- [ ] Create comprehensive set of price exercises
  - [ ] Map all combinations of grammatical cases and number patterns
  - [ ] Ensure correct linguistic forms for each combination
- [ ] Design metadata structure for exercise categorization
- [ ] Implement exercise generation system that maintains grammatical accuracy
- [ ] Add optional links to grammatical explanations

## 4. User Authentication
- [ ] Integrate Google Authentication
- [ ] Create user profile database structure
- [ ] Implement login/logout functionality
- [ ] Set up session management tied to user profiles
- [ ] Create onboarding flow for new users

## 5. Performance Tracking Enhancements
- [ ] Expand current tracking to include hierarchical levels
- [ ] Implement visualization of performance by category
